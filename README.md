# Silakka44

Silakka44 is a RP2040 based 44-key column staggered split keyboard. PCB uses hotswap sockets. Design is inpired from REVIUNG41 and Corne keyboards.

PCB is designed for MX style key switches. Current top plate only supports MX style switches. 5-pin switches is supported.

[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmwarehttp:// "QMK") and [Vial](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk "Vial") firmwares has very barebones key mapping. Good for quick testing.

You can find build guide [here.](https://github.com/Squalius-cephalus/silakka44/blob/main/buildguide/README.md "here.")


PCB design uses footprints from [ScottoKeebs](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Extras/ScottoKicad "ScottoKeebs") and [kbd library.](https://github.com/foostan/kbd "kbd library.")

### Bugs
Sometimes the encoder buttons are "stuck" when the keyboard is connected to the computer. Pressing those once fixes the problem.

### TODO
1. Redo traces
2. Fix bugs
