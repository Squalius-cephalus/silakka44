# Silakka44

Silakka44 is 44-key column staggered split keyboard. PCB has hotswap sockets.

PCB is designed for MX style key switches. Current top plate only supports MX style switches. 5-pin switches is supported.

[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmwarehttp:// "QMK") and [Vial](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk "Vial") firmwares has very barebones key mapping. Good for quick testing.
